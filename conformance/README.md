# SemVer-Trust Conformance Vectors

These vectors are the **sync contract** between the [SemVer-Trust specification](../spec/semver-trust.md)
and every implementation of it. They are data, not prose: a conformance harness loads them, exercises the
implementation under test, and asserts the implementation reproduces the encoded expectations. The Go
reference implementation treats them as acceptance tests, and any other implementation claims conformance by
passing them.

The Go reference implementation currently implements the draft v0.3 vector
set. The v0.4–v0.8 range, policy-transition, version-ancestry, successor
predicate, qualified-review, threshold-decision, and derivation-fail-closed
groups in this revision are the source contract for its next coordinated,
digest-pinned update.

Each vector is derived directly from a normative section of the spec and carries a `spec` back-reference to
it. The vectors in this directory cover **level assignment** (§3.2, §3.3, §4.1–§4.2), **version precedence
and tag grammar** (§7.1, §7.2), **aggregation** (§5.1–§5.2 scope partitioning and floors, §5.4 meta-paths,
with §4.4 derivation claims ignored for portable re-leveling), **transitive propagation** (§5.3, including SCC
collapse), **release intervals and predecessor continuity** (§5.2), **policy transitions** (§5.4),
**authenticated version ancestry** (§7.5), **qualified review** (§4.3), and **release decisions** (§6.1–§6.4
with §7.1 encoding). Every step of the spec's Appendix A worked example is reproduced as a vector (ids
containing `appendix-a`).
Cryptographic verification fixtures —
vendored test keys, the allowed-signers registry, deterministically built fixture repositories, and SSH
signature vectors (§4.2, §10 step 5) — live under [`crypto/`](crypto/README.md), which also documents the v1
capability limitation (SSH-only, with fail-closed behavior on other key families proven by vector).

`../scripts/check-conformance.py` is a *self-consistency* check: it re-implements the spec rules a second
time (independently of both the reference implementation and `check-drift.py`) and confirms the vectors agree
with that implementation. It is not the conformance harness — a harness runs the *implementation under test*
against these vectors.

## `spec_version` pinning

Every vector file carries a top-level `spec_version` (currently `"0.8"`). It names the spec draft the vectors
encode, not the version of the vector set. The rules:

- The vectors track the pinned spec draft. When they say `"0.8"`, their expectations are those of
  `spec/semver-trust.md` **Draft v0.8**.
- All vector files in this directory MUST share the same `spec_version`; the validator enforces this and
  cross-checks it against the spec's draft header.
- An implementation claims conformance **against a `spec_version`** — "conforms to SemVer-Trust 0.8 level and
  precedence vectors" is the precise claim.

The frozen v0.1 DSSE fixtures retain their v0.1 predicate bytes while their
vector envelope is pinned to spec draft 0.8. Passing those vectors proves
**backward verification** of historical v0.1 attestations only. It does not make
v0.1 sufficient for a v0.8 release-conformance claim; §8.1 requires the v0.2
successor predicate before v0.8 release emission.

The range, policy-transition, and version-ancestry files isolate independent
dimensions for precise failures. Their authority fixtures are projections, not
three alternative wire formats: a real accepted successor combines every
source-interval, policy, and version-state field required by §8.1.
`predicate-v0.2.json` adds unsigned positive and negative in-toto Statement
payload fixtures for the successor schemas. The crypto attestation vectors also
include signed positive DSSE envelopes for the v0.2 release and review
successor predicates.

## Vector format

Every vector file shares an envelope:

```json
{
  "$comment": "SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0",
  "spec_version": "0.8",
  "description": "…what this file covers…",
  "vectors": [ /* … */ ]
}
```

Every vector, regardless of file, has these common fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Stable, unique identifier, e.g. `levels/matrix/agent-none`. Never reused or repurposed. |
| `kind` | string | Selects the consumption rule: `matrix`, `classify`, `precedence`, `grammar`, `scope_partition`, `scope_floor`, `meta_path`, `propagation`, `release_range`, `version_ancestry`, `policy_transition`, `review_qualification`, or `decision`. |
| `description` | string | Human-readable intent; editorial, not asserted. |
| `spec` | string | Back-reference to the governing spec section, e.g. `§3.2`. Never empty. |

### `levels.json` — `kind: "matrix"`

Already-classified authorship and review classes mapped to a level. Tests the level function in isolation.

| Field | Type | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs.authorship` | string | `agent`, `mixed`, `ambiguous`, `human` |
| `inputs.review` | string | `none`, `agent_independent`, `human_distinct`, `human_same_identity` |
| `expected.level` | string | `T0`, `T1`, `T2`, `T3` |

`human_same_identity` is self-review, which does not count as review (§3.2 note 2); it appears only on the
`human` authorship row. The matrix group covers every `authorship × review` combination exhaustively.

### `levels.json` — `kind: "classify"`

Raw commit facts mapped to the derived classes **and** the level. Tests the classifier plus the level
function end to end.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs.signer_identity_class` | string | `human` or `agent` — the verified signer's identity class (§4.2). |
| `inputs.trailers` | object | Git trailers. `Provenance` is `human`/`agent`/`mixed`; `Co-authored-by` is a list of unsigned co-authors. |
| `inputs.policy` | object | `{ "trailers_require": bool }` — whether policy mandates provenance trailers (§4.1). |
| `inputs.review` | object or null | Review facts, or `null` when there is no review. |
| `inputs.review.reviewer_identity_class` | string | `human` or `agent`. |
| `inputs.review.reviewer_identity` | string | The reviewer's identity. |
| `inputs.review.author_identity` | string | The commit's verified **signer principal** (the name predates ADR-025's clarification). Same-identity tests: disqualifies agent review (§3.3(2)); for human review it prevents double-counting only — a same-identity human review of agent/mixed/ambiguous-authored work still counts as the one accountable human (§3.2 note 2, ADR-025). |
| `inputs.review.separate_context` | bool | Whether the reviewer ran with no shared state (§3.3(1)). |
| `inputs.review.signed_attestation` | bool | Whether a signed review attestation exists (§3.3(3)). |
| `expected.authorship` | string | Derived authorship class. |
| `expected.review` | string | Derived review class (a non-qualifying review classifies as `none`). |
| `expected.level` | string | Resulting level, consistent with `expected.authorship` and `expected.review`. |

### `precedence.json` — `kind: "precedence"`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ordered` | array of string | Version strings in **strictly increasing** precedence order (no ties). |
| `note` | string | Why the ordering holds; editorial. |

### `precedence.json` — `kind: "grammar"`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `tag` | string | The tag string to parse. |
| `expected.outcome` | string | `trust_version`, `plain_version`, or `invalid`. |
| `expected.component_path` | string or null | Extracted path prefix (e.g. `pkg/common`), or `null`. |
| `expected.core` | string or null | Extracted `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, or `null` for `invalid`. |
| `expected.level` | int or null | Trust level `0`–`3`, or `null` when there is no trust suffix. |
| `expected.iteration` | int or null | Iteration (≥ 1), or `null` when there is no trust suffix. |
| `expected.prerelease` | string or null | For `plain_version`, the non-trust pre-release (e.g. `rc.1`); otherwise `null`. |
| `expected.reason` | string or null | For `invalid`, why the tag is rejected; otherwise `null`. |

The three grammar outcomes are distinct on purpose:

- **`trust_version`** — matches the §7.1 grammar: either a clean `[path/]vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` or a trust
  suffix `-tLEVEL.ITERATION`. Trust components are extracted.
- **`plain_version`** — a valid SemVer version whose pre-release is not trust-shaped (e.g. `rc.1`). It is
  accepted as an ordinary pre-release with the trust suffix **absent**, not rejected. This keeps
  non-trust tags (rc/alpha/beta) usable while the trust layer simply reports "no trust information".
- **`invalid`** — a *trust-shaped* pre-release (begins with `t` then a digit) that violates the trust
  grammar (two-digit level, missing/zero iteration, level out of range), or a string that is not a valid
  `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag at all. A malformed trust attempt is rejected loudly rather than silently
  ignored.

### `aggregation.json` — kind: `scope_partition`

Diff-path lists mapped through a policy scope-glob map (§5.1). Globs are gitignore-style and segment-aware:
`*` matches within a path segment, `**` matches across segments (so `services/auth/**` does not match
`services/authz/…`). Paths matching no glob fall into the implicit `default` scope.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs.scopes` | object | Policy scope map: glob → scope name (§9 `[scopes]`). |
| `inputs.commits[]` | array | Commits in range; each has `id` (string) and `paths` (diff-path list). |
| `expected.scopes` | object | Scope name → ids of the commits touching it, in input order. Untouched scopes are absent. |

### `aggregation.json` — kind: `scope_floor`

Same inputs plus per-commit levels; asserts the §5.2 per-scope floor. A commit MAY carry a `derivation`
object as non-authoritative metadata or an adversarial fixture. Under the draft v0.8 portable baseline,
derivation metadata never raises path trust: every changed path contributes the commit's raw `level`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs.scopes` | object | Policy scope map, as above. |
| `inputs.commits[]` | array | Each has `id`, `level` (`T0`–`T3`), `paths`, and optionally `derivation`. |
| `inputs.commits[].derivation` | object | Non-authoritative metadata; implementations MUST ignore it for portable trust re-leveling. |
| `expected.own_trust` | object | Scope name → floored own trust (`T0`–`T3`) for every touched scope. |

### `aggregation.json` — kind: `meta_path`

The §5.4 hard-fail rule: a range containing a meta-path commit below the required level MUST fail
verification outright — not demote, fail.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs.meta` | object | `{ "paths": [globs], "required_level": "T0"–"T3" }` (§9 `[meta]`). |
| `inputs.commits[]` | array | Each has `id`, `level`, `paths`. |
| `expected.outcome` | string | `verified` or `verification_failed`. |
| `expected.violations` | array | Ids of under-leveled commits touching a meta-path (empty when `verified`). |

### `propagation.json` — kind: `propagation`

Effective trust over the internal dependency graph (§5.3): `effective(C) = min(own(C), min over deps D of
effective(D))`, with cycles collapsed to their strongly connected component.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs.nodes` | object | Component name → own trust (`T0`–`T3`). |
| `inputs.edges` | array | Directed edges `[consumer, dependency]`. |
| `expected.effective` | object | Component name → effective trust, for every node. |
| `expected.floor_source` | object | Optional. Component name → the component whose own trust set the floor (the node itself when its own trust attains the minimum). |

### `range.json` — kind: `release_range`

Release-interval membership and predecessor validation (§5.2, ADR-027). The
commit fixtures are oldest-first topological parent graphs; interval membership
is the normative assertion, while fixture order serializes `expected.commits`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs.mode` | string | `inception`, `adoption`, or `recurring`. |
| `inputs.commits[]` | array | Commit graph nodes: immutable `id` and parent-id list. |
| `inputs.to` | string | Resolved release target object ID. |
| `inputs.existing_chain_heads` | integer | Number of continuity-capable accepted heads known for this repository/component chain and profile; legacy v0.1 attestations are not such heads. |
| `inputs.requested_from` | string or null | Caller-supplied compatibility input; recurrence accepts only the predecessor `TO`. |
| `inputs.boundary` | object or null | Resolved/pinned boundary facts for adoption mode. |
| `inputs.predecessor` | object or null | Accepted/head/repository/component/`TO`/tag-target facts for recurrence. |
| `expected.outcome` | string | `verified` or `verification_failed`. |
| `expected.commits` | array | Exact interval members in fixture order; empty on failure. |
| `expected.reason` | string or null | Stable failure category, or null on success. |

### `version-ancestry.json` — kind: `version_ancestry`

Authenticated version-state selection and exact-tag derivation (§7.5,
ADR-029). Top-level graphs, ref sets, decision inputs, bootstraps, predecessors,
superseded decisions, and target reevaluations are immutable fixtures referenced
by each vector. A `decision` fixture contains the ordinary §6 inputs but no
version baseline or iteration; those are selected and derived by the ancestry
rule.
Accepted-state fixtures also carry any pending corrective bump created by an
attestation-only semantic invalidation; only `advance` may consume and clear it.
Their `target_intervals` list is the authenticated target lineage that a re-cut
or an advance from an unpromoted target must carry forward.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs.authority` | string | `bootstrap`, `predecessor`, or `superseded`. |
| `inputs.action` | string | Signed `advance`, `recut`, or `supersede` intent. |
| `inputs.graph` / `inputs.refs` | string | Named commit graph and observed raw/peeled tag-ref set. |
| `inputs.bootstrap` | string or null | Authenticated chain-genesis fixture, including tag prefix and version predecessor/null genesis marker. |
| `inputs.predecessor` | string or null | Accepted source predecessor carrying version state. |
| `inputs.superseded` | string or null | Accepted decision whose source/version target is being re-evaluated. |
| `inputs.decision` | string | Named §6 decision-input fixture; its effective bump/channel feed exact-tag derivation. |
| `inputs.target_reevaluation` | string, optional | Authenticated complete-lineage reevaluation required when a re-cut or advance from an unpromoted target raises trust; absence means none, never a caller-selected scalar. |
| `inputs.requested_version_predecessor` | string or null | Untrusted compatibility assertion; when present it must equal the authenticated predecessor and never selects it. |
| `inputs.requested_iteration` | integer or null | Untrusted compatibility assertion; when present it must equal the derived iteration and never selects it. |
| `expected.version_predecessor` | string or null | Authenticated prior canonical tag, or null at explicit new-line genesis. |
| `expected.target_core` | string or null | Derived target core on success. |
| `expected.iteration` | integer or null | Derived trust iteration; null for clean or attestation-only outcomes. |
| `expected.version` | string or null | Exact new tag, or null for failure or any attestation-only outcome. |
| `expected.advances_version_head` | bool | Whether the accepted result may supply version state to the next source release; late supersessions are attestation-only and false. |
| `expected.corrective_floor` | string | Optional. Corrective bump bound by a current-head semantic invalidation (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`). |
| `expected.reason` | string or null | Stable failure category, or null on success. |

### `policy-transition.json` — kind: `policy_transition`

Bootstrap and previous-policy governance (§5.4, ADR-028). Top-level `policies`,
`bootstraps`, and `predecessors` are immutable named fixtures referenced by each
vector.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs.authority` | string | `bootstrap` at chain genesis or `predecessor` thereafter. |
| `inputs.active_policy` | string | Policy fixture that evaluates the current interval. |
| `inputs.candidate_policy` | string | Policy fixture proposed for activation after success. |
| `inputs.bootstrap` | string or null | Bootstrap fixture reference. |
| `inputs.predecessor` | string or null | Accepted predecessor fixture reference. |
| `inputs.clock_profile` | string | Injected-clock semantics pinned by the bootstrap/predecessor authority. |
| `inputs.verification_time` | RFC 3339 string | Explicit verifier-supplied instant used under the bound clock profile; implicit/candidate-selected system time is invalid. |
| `inputs.provided_trust_material` | object | Repository/explicit byte locators represented by path → observed digest. |
| `inputs.commits[]` | array | Current-interval signer, level, and diff-path facts. |
| `expected.evaluated_policy` | string | Active policy digest selected by authority. |
| `expected.activated_policy` | string or null | Candidate digest activated after success; null on failure. |
| `expected.reason` | string or null | Stable failure category, or null on success. |

Each policy and authority fixture carries `trust_material` as path → digest and
`trust_roles` as role → path. Both mappings are bound: equal bytes assigned to
the wrong role are a mismatch, not interchangeable trust.
Authority fixtures also carry concrete `mandatory_meta_paths` for
attestation-generating workflows. Active and candidate policies must cover
those paths; a candidate cannot remove that protection in-band.

### `review-qualification.json` — kind: `review_qualification`

Qualified-review classification (§4.3, ADR-031). These vectors operate after
basic commit authorship classification and assert whether review facts count as
`none`, `agent_independent`, or `human_distinct`, and therefore which level the
commit receives.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs.authorship.class` | string | Already-classified authorship: `agent`, `mixed`, `ambiguous`, or `human`. |
| `inputs.authorship.actor` | string | Canonical actor id for the author or signer when one exists. |
| `inputs.review.class` | string | Reviewer class: `human` or `agent`. |
| `inputs.review.actor` | string | Canonical actor id for the reviewer. |
| `inputs.review.credential_actor` | string | Canonical actor selected by mapping the review credential/platform account under the active actor profile. |
| `inputs.review.verdict` | string | Forge/source-control verdict (`approved`, `changes_requested`, or `commented`). |
| `inputs.review.approval_state` | string | Active-state fact (`active`, `withdrawn`, `dismissed`, or `stale`). |
| `inputs.review.coverage` | string | `final_revision` or `final_diff`. |
| `inputs.review.approved_revision` | string | Revision the approval names. |
| `inputs.review.final_revision` | string | Final reviewed source revision. |
| `inputs.review.approved_diff` / `result_diff` | string | Optional diff digests used for supported squash/rebase flows. |
| `inputs.review.effective_at_merge` | bool | Whether source-control state still considered the approval effective at merge. |
| `inputs.review.signed_attestation` | bool | Whether the review facts were captured in a signed attestation. |
| `inputs.review.separate_context` | bool | Agent-review-only evidence of independent execution context. |
| `inputs.merge.strategy` | string | `merge`, `squash`, or `rebase`. |
| `inputs.merge.capture_mode` | string | `native` or `pre_rewrite`. |
| `inputs.merge.post_approval_change` | bool | Whether source/target/result changed after approval without re-approval. |
| `expected.review` | string | Counted review class: `none`, `agent_independent`, or `human_distinct`. |
| `expected.level` | string | Resulting level under §3.2. |
| `expected.reason` | string or null | Stable non-qualification category, or null when the review qualifies. |

### `decision.json` — kind: `decision`

The §6.4 baseline decision/rendering kernel with §6.1 semantic floor, §6.2
threshold gate, §6.3 strategies, and §7.1 encoding. Its version fields are
authenticated §7.5 intermediate values, not caller inputs; `version-ancestry.json`
verifies their selection. The threshold gate runs before the blast/differ table.
`differ proof required` cells resolve to pre-release when `differ_available` is
false (§1.1 honest degradation).

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs.effective_trust` | string | `T0`–`T3`. |
| `inputs.threshold` | string | Minimum effective trust eligible for the clean channel (`T0`–`T3`). |
| `inputs.blast` | string | Qualitative blast score: `low`, `moderate`, `high` (§6.2). |
| `inputs.strategy` | string | `demote` or `inflate` (§6.3). |
| `inputs.differ_available` | bool | Whether a compatibility differ exists for the ecosystem (§6.1). |
| `inputs.semantic_floor` | string | The §6.1 minimum bump: `patch`, `minor`, `major`. |
| `inputs.claimed_bump` | string | The claimed bump, same values. |
| `inputs.authenticated_version_base` | string | Clean §7.1 rendering baseline already selected by authenticated version state. |
| `inputs.authenticated_iteration` | int | Trust iteration already derived from accepted version state (≥ 1). |
| `expected.channel` | string | `clean` or `prerelease`. |
| `expected.bump` | string or null | Final bump: max of claim and semantic floor (the floor is honored unconditionally). |
| `expected.version` | string or null | The exact §7.1 tag. |
| `expected.escalate` | bool | Present on `inflate` vectors only: whether the bump escalates. Escalated vectors carry `null` bump/version, because the escalation target (MINOR vs MAJOR) is a policy choice the spec does not pin (§6.3). |

## How a harness consumes each group

- **`matrix`** — feed `inputs.authorship` and `inputs.review` to the level-assignment function; assert the
  result equals `expected.level`.
- **`classify`** — feed the raw `inputs` (signer identity class, trailers, policy, review facts) to the
  classifier; assert the derived authorship and review classes equal `expected.authorship` /
  `expected.review`, and the assigned level equals `expected.level`.
- **`review_qualification`** — classify review facts under §4.3; assert the counted review class, level,
  and non-qualification reason.
- **`precedence`** — parse every string in `ordered`, sort by the implementation's SemVer precedence, and
  assert the sorted sequence equals `ordered`. Equivalently, assert each entry has strictly lower precedence
  than the next; equal precedence is a failure.
- **`grammar`** — parse `tag`; assert `expected.outcome`, and for `trust_version` / `plain_version` assert
  the extracted `component_path`, `core`, `level`, `iteration`, and `prerelease` match.
- **`scope_partition`** — partition `inputs.commits` by diff paths through `inputs.scopes`; assert the
  scope → commits map equals `expected.scopes`.
- **`scope_floor`** — compute the per-scope own-trust floor (ignoring any `derivation` metadata for re-leveling);
  assert it equals `expected.own_trust`.
- **`meta_path`** — evaluate the §5.4 rule over `inputs.commits` against `inputs.meta`; assert
  `expected.outcome` and `expected.violations`. `verification_failed` means the whole range fails — an
  implementation MUST NOT translate it into a demotion.
- **`propagation`** — compute effective trust over the graph with SCC collapse; assert
  `expected.effective` for every node, and `expected.floor_source` where present.
- **`release_range`** — compute the §5.2 reachability set and validate the
  boundary/predecessor facts; assert outcome, exact commit membership, and
  failure reason.
- **`version_ancestry`** — select bootstrap/predecessor/superseded version
  state, validate raw and peeled refs plus ancestry, derive target/iteration,
  and assert the exact tag or stable failure reason.
- **`policy_transition`** — select active policy from bootstrap/predecessor,
  enforce active identities plus union meta paths, validate candidate
  invariants, and assert evaluated/activated policy digests and failure reason.
- **`decision`** — run the §6 baseline decision function; assert channel, bump, and the exact
  version string (or, for escalated `inflate` vectors, that the bump escalates).

## Versioning and stability

- Vector `id`s are stable. A published `id` is never renamed, reused, or given a different meaning.
- **Adding** vectors (new `id`s) is non-breaking and does not require a `spec_version` bump.
- **Changing** a vector's asserted values (`expected`, `ordered`, or `tag`) is a semantic change that MUST
  accompany a spec change and a `spec_version` bump — implementations pin to a `spec_version`, so silently
  altering an expectation would break conformance claims.
- `description` and `note` fields are editorial and may be refined without a version bump.
