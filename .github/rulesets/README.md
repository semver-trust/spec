# Branch rulesets — settings as reviewable artifacts

These files are the source of truth for the `main` branch's protection,
committed so an outsider can see exactly what governs the branch the
verifiable history lives on. Apply them via *Settings → Rules → Rulesets →
Import a ruleset*; change them by editing the file and re-importing, never by
click-editing alone. `scripts/check-rulesets.py` compares the live settings
against these files and fails on drift.

Two rulesets, split by bypass policy (a bypass actor bypasses *every* rule in
a ruleset, so rules that must bind everyone live apart from rules a
maintainer may bypass):

| File | Rules | Bypass |
|---|---|---|
| `branch-main-history-integrity.json` | no deletion, no force push, signed commits | **nobody** — history integrity is absolute |
| `branch-main-review-gate.json` | PR required (merge commits only), status checks (`verify`) | Repository role **Admin** (`actor_id: 5`), mode `always` |

The review-gate bypass exists for the ADR-023 local-merge flow: the
maintainer pushes a locally-created, signed, trailered merge commit
(the merge-flow script in the implementation repository refuses to create
one unless the PR is open with green checks, so the process the bypass
skips is still enforced by tooling).
The bypass is granted to the Admin *role*, not a named account — what is
committed here is byte-for-byte what is applied, with no personal variation.

Notes:

- `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` targets whatever the default branch is; no hardcoded
  branch names.
- The organization-level tag ruleset is managed at the org and is
  deliberately not represented here.
- "Require linear history" must stay absent: this repository is
  merge-commits-only (spec §4.3.3), the opposite of linear.
- **Migration**: rulesets and classic branch protection can coexist
  (most-restrictive-wins), so import these first, confirm a test push
  behaves, then delete any classic branch protection on `main`. The drift
  check sees rulesets only — classic protection is invisible to it, which
  is one more reason to finish the migration.
- These files are configuration that protects the system; they are the
  spec-repo counterpart of the implementation repository's identical
  arrangement.
